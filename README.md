Mission Demolition Enhancements

I added 4 levels with increasing difficulty, along with a game over screen and a play again button. The slingshot now makes a sound when used, and the rubber band has a visible effect. The projectile explodes on impact, complete with a particle effect and sound. This makes the game more enjoyable and playable, as the explosion can clear blocks that would otherwise block the goal.
